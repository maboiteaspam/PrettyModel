Pretty ORM
A php ORM made to be pretty.

Based on Idiorm and Paris

Improved by use of Annotations in a Doctrine like fashion
Improved by automatic create, update of the database schema in a Lazy fashion

Provide support for Mysql, and incomplete support of SQLite

Does yet know how to create, read, update, delete a model
Does yet know how to associate models in one-one, one-many, many-many, many-one
Does yet provide a SQL writer

Does provide integration for PHPUnit testing

Is PSR-0 compliant

Looking forward to be full PSR compliant

- Summarize missing stuff, ToBeDone.

Stuff in progress
- composer integration
